					Organize your FAQs so they are easy to search
If you have a lot of FAQs, pay special attention to how you organize them on your site. Here are three ideas to consider:

Sort your questions by audience type: Complex questions might be inappropriate for a FAQ page for beginners, but straightforward questions are definite candidates. For the techie customers, you might have a section called Questions for Advanced Users that isolates more complex and intimidating answers in one place.
List the questions alphabetically: There’s nothing more frustrating than having to search through a haystack of questions for the needle of an answer.
Group your FAQs by question type, and give each group a heading: This helps customers find their information faster.
Make your FAQs easy to find and search
It may be hard to get past the assumption that a FAQ page is a dust-covered museum of questions from the early 2000s. Just as FAQs change, so should your approaches to FAQ presentation. What works today may be obsolete in a year or two. That said, here are a couple of approaches that work in today’s Web world.

Extract top questions
Use a software utility to extract the top questions and list them as a sidebar. The faq.myspace.com page of MySpace and the Help Center of Facebook do an excellent job of presenting information in a way that reassures customers that the information is current and accurate.

Call the FAQ page something different
Don’t call the FAQ a FAQ. If you have lots of questions, consider a more useful name that tells customers what the questions are about. For instance:

If your questions supplement your support, call it a Support Center, as AVG does.
If your questions are all about how to set up an account, call your page Getting Started.
Provide a printable version
Make the FAQs easily printable. Particularly when an instruction calls for a system reboot, it’s handy for the customer to be able to refer to printed instructions and to return to the URL once they are back online.

Reference the FAQ page throughout your site
Refer to the FAQ page from elsewhere. For example, if you have a FAQ section on Return Policies that limits returns on certain clothing types, you can link to it from those types of clothing. This indicates to customers that you respect their time enough to point out important information before they buy.

Encourage readers to ask questions
Include a link so that customers can ask questions that don’t yet exist in your FAQ repertoire.

Go social
Create opportunities for readers to add to the topics, answer other readers’ questions, or rate an answer.

Checking a company’s FAQ page is a little like peeking into a family’s kitchen during a dinner party. It reveals the personality of the household: smooth and organized or neglected and disheveled. A dynamic FAQ page can be a valuable part of your Web site, particularly if it’s considered a knowledge asset and maintained with the same care as the rest of the material on the site.
